Short description of the available command line arguments for this Arrowhead Provider implementation

1) -d
  Starts the webserver in "debug" mode. Every incoming request to the REST resource and the corresponding response will be printed to the console
  output (URL + request body)

2) -daemon
  Starts the java executable in daemon mode, which is useful in Linux environments. Processes in daemon mode will receive a kill signal when the
  process is terminated (except when force killing it -9) and the java process can shutdown gracefully, unregistering its offering from the Service
  Registry before shutting down.

3) -tls
  Invokes the "secure mode", where the webserver will use HTTPS/TLS with X.509 certificates.

4) -ff (from file)
  This tells the program that instead of building the JSON payloads for its request from scratch, use the provided JSON files (the path of where to
  find these files has to be set in the app.properties config file)

5) -auth
  Send an IntraCloudAuth request to the Authorization Core System when starting. This feature can only work in secure mode, if the Authorization
  enables access to application systems in the local cloud.

6) -orch
  Register into the Orchestration Store when starting. This feature only works in insecure mode, since the Orchestrator will only allow the cloud
  operator to use this REST endpoint in secure mode.
